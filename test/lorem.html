	Free space, sometimes called fill factor, can be used to leave a portion of a
tablespace or index empty and available to store newly added data. The
specification of free space in a tablespace or index can reduce the frequency
of reorganization, reduce contention, and increase the efficiency of insertion.
Each DBMS provides a method of specifying free space for a database object
in the CREATE and ALTER statements. A typical parameter is PCTFREE,
where the DBA specifies the percentage of each data page that should remain
available for future inserts. Another possible parameter is FREEPAGE,
where the DBA indicates the specified number of pages after which a
completely empty page is available.
